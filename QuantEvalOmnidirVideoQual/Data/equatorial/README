The equatorial view directions set is very simple -- nine view directions
evenly spaced around the equator, each with a 30 degree field of view:

  Yaw Pitch  Roll    FOV
    0     0     0     30
   40     0     0     30
   80     0     0     30
  120     0     0     30
  160     0     0     30
  200     0     0     30
  240     0     0     30
  280     0     0     30
  320     0     0     30
