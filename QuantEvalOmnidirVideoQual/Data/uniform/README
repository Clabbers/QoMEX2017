The uniform view directions set is chosen specifically to hit the interesting
points of a cubemap: the vertices, edge centers, and face centers. For
implemntation reasons it was convenient to have 25 directions, so the south pole
was dropped since there is currently rarely any interesting content there.

This is of course not uniform in a strong mathematical sense, but it served
our purposes well and seemed a reasonable name. All the view directions again
span a 30 degree field of view.

For a cube, the cube vertices are further away and hence drop towards the
horizon when viewed from the origin. The pitch associated with this is equal to
the atan(1 / sqrt(2)), which is approximated in the table below as 35.3 degrees.
