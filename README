This repository contains a paper presented at the QoMEX 2017 conference titled
"Quantitative Evaluation of Omnidirectional Video Quality", and is provided here
for review and further analysis. The directory hierarchy at:

	QuantEvalOmnidirVideoQual/Data 

contains a large collection of PSNR/SSIM data for each frame of a given video
under varying conditions. This data was used to generate the graphs and
analysis discussed in the paper and is provided here for review and further
analysis.

The format of the data is a .CSV file with a header line explaining the format,
which is very simple. Here is an example of the beginning of a data file:

    bytes,psnr,ssim
    581696.0,29.971724311,0.845026741971
    1874.0,29.9716365029,0.845026312268
    46411.0,29.8902770322,0.841674323555
    3533.0,29.8652043131,0.841132400651

There are three columns:
  * The first is the frame size in bytes
  * Second is the overall YCrCb PSNR (MSE computed for all pixels in all
    frames, then PSNR computed)
  * Third is the average of individual frame luma SSIM

The directory structure and filename describe what the data files measure.
It's structure is as follows, it will make more sense if you have read the
paper above.

<view_directions>       (uniform, tropical, equatorial)
  <projection>         (cubemap, eac, equirect)
    <video_number>     (1, 2, 3, ...)
      <resolution>     (720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p)
        crf_<crf>.csv    (ffmpeg constant rate factor for encoding)

So the file:
  equatorial/cubemap/16/720/crf_21.csv

contains the per frame data for:
  * equatorial view directions
  * cubemap projection
  * video #16
  * 720p
  * ffmpeg constant rate factor of 21

The view directions are specific collections of virtual headset views for
which PSNR and SSIM are computed then aggregated. The details of each is
included in a README at the root of each directory.
